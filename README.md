# Mpu6050-AirGuitar-Project
This project is a gesture-based digital air guitar built using an Arduino, MPU6050 accelerometer, touch sensors, and a DFPlayer Mini audio module. By selecting a chord using touch sensors and performing a strumming motion in the air, realistic guitar sounds are played instantly.
